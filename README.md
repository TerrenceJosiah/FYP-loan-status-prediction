## **A Comparative Study of Predicting Loan Status of a Lending Company using Various Machine Learning Algorithms**
Abstract: <br>
In the realm of financial services, predicting loan grades plays a vital role in assessing the 
creditworthiness of borrowers and managing the risk associated with lending operations. This 
study conducts a comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms for predicting 
loan grades in a lending company. The primary objective is to identify the most effective 
algorithm that can accurately classify loan applicants into appropriate grade categories. 
To achieve this, historical data of loan applicants from the lending company is collected and 
pre-processed. Various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Gaussian 
Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bootstrap Aggregating, Adaptive Boosting, Light 
Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, are evaluated on the dataset. 
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the 
predictive capabilities of each algorithm. Additionally, computational efficiency and model 
interpretability are considered to strike a balance between predictive accuracy and practicality. 
The results of the comparative study reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in 
predicting loan grades. The findings shed light on the optimal algorithm to be employed for 
loan grade prediction, offering valuable insights for lending companies to enhance their credit 
risk assessment strategies and improve decision-making processes. 
Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge in the field of credit risk 
assessment and demonstrates the significance of leveraging machine learning algorithms for 
predicting loan grades in the context of a lending company. The implications of the research 
can potentially enhance the efficiency and accuracy of loan grading systems, thereby promoting 
financial stability and sustainable lending practices.
